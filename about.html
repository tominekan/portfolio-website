                My name is Tomi Adenekan. I am 14 years old (currently) and I like to eat, code, read, and learn.
                My favourite subjects are coding (obviously), biology, and mandarin (我的中文不好).
                The clubs I am involved in are Ethics Bowl and Business Innovation Club (where I am Vice President).
                I like coding because of two reasons. One being that it is possible to change the world without getting up from the computer seat.
                The second being that it is not easy to code and it takes patience in order to code. 
                I find it a bit ironic because the computer executes code incredibly fast, but development takes a lot of time because of its human aspect.
                I am currently in 9th grade trying to develop some projects here and there.
